   -> useState : used untill we dont need side effect example : need to connect with backend or setInterval kind thing are not introduced
   -> useEffect : used to do side effect like fetch, setInterval, setTimeout, addEventListener, removeEventListener
                serve as componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, componentWillUnmount of class based component.
   -> useMemo : It means remembring some output given an input and not computing it again , like caching.
                pehle se hi output store karke rakhta hai, agar input same hai toh wahi output return karta hai.
