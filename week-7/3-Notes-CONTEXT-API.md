1. **Introduction**: The Context API is a feature in React that allows you to share data across all levels of the application. It's used for sharing "global" data that can be accessed by multiple components.

2. **Creating Context**: You create a Context using React's `createContext` method. This returns a Context object.
   ```jsx
   const MyContext = React.createContext();
   ```

3. **Context.Provider**: This is a React component that allows consuming components to subscribe to context changes. The `value` prop is used to pass the current context value to the component's descendants.
   ```jsx
   <MyContext.Provider value={/* some value */}>
   ```

4. **Context.Consumer**: This is a React component that subscribes to context changes. It allows you to subscribe to a context within a function component.
   ```jsx
   <MyContext.Consumer>
     {value => /* render something based on the context value */}
   </MyContext.Consumer>
   ```

5. **useContext Hook**: The `useContext` hook is used to consume the context value. It allows you to read the context and renders whenever this context value changes.
   ```jsx
   const contextValue = useContext(MyContext);
   ```

6. **Example of Context API**: Here's a simple example of how to use the Context API:
   ```jsx
   import React, { useContext } from 'react';

   const NameContext = React.createContext('Default Name');
   
   function ParentComponent() {
     return (
       <NameContext.Provider value="John">
         <ChildComponent />
       </NameContext.Provider>
     );

   function ChildComponent() {
     const name = useContext(NameContext);
     return <p>{name}</p>;
   }
   }
   ```

7. **When to Use Context API**: Use the Context API when some data needs to be accessible by many components at different nesting levels. If you only want to avoid passing some props through many levels, component composition is often a simpler solution than context.
