# Selector Family Notes

## Overview

In Recoil, selectors allow for derived state, computed from the application's state. When dealing with dynamic computations or multiple instances of derived state, the `selectorFamily` function becomes essential. This markdown document explores the differences between `selector` and `selectorFamily`, the necessity of `selectorFamily`, and its edge cases.

## Example Usage

```javascript
// Atoms.js
import { atomFamily, selector, selectorFamily } from "recoil";

export const todosAtomFamily = atomFamily({
  key: 'todosAtomFamily',
  default: selectorFamily({
    key: "todoSelectorFamily",
    get: (id) => async ({ get }) => {  
      const res = await axios.get(`https://sum-server.100xdevs.com/todo?id=${id}`);
      return res.data.todo;
    },
  })
});

// App.jsx
import './App.css';
import { RecoilRoot, useRecoilValue } from 'recoil';
import { todosAtomFamily } from './atoms';

// App component
function App() {
  return (
    <RecoilRoot>
      <Todo id={1} />
      <Todo id={2} />
    </RecoilRoot>
  );
} 

// Todo component
function Todo({ id }) {
  const todo = useRecoilValue(todosAtomFamily(id));

  return (
    <>
      {todo.title}
      {todo.description}
      <br />
    </>
  );
}

export default App;

```

## Difference between Selector and Selector Family

- **Selector**:
  - Represents derived state computed from the application's state.
  - Computes a single derived value.
  - Suitable for managing static or singular computations.

- **Selector Family**:
  - Represents a family of selectors.
  - Dynamically creates selectors based on a provided parameter or key.
  - Each selector in the family computes a separate derived value.
  - Ideal for managing dynamic or multiple instances of derived state, such as individual todos.

## Why Use Selector Family

- **Dynamic Computation**:
  - Enables the creation of multiple derived values based on varying parameters, allowing for dynamic computation.
  - Each selector computes its derived value independently, providing granular control over each instance.

- **Component-Level Derived State**:
  - Useful when different components require their own independent derived state instances.
  - Avoids sharing derived state across components, preventing unintended side effects.

- **Efficient Updates**:
  - Selectors and selector families are memoized, ensuring efficient updates and avoiding unnecessary recomputation.
  - Enhances performance in scenarios where derived state depends on changing parameters or inputs.

## Edge Cases

- **Dynamic Computation Parameters**:
  - When computed values depend on dynamic parameters or inputs, `selectorFamily` allows for dynamic computation setup.
  - Facilitates scenarios where the computation logic varies based on dynamic factors.

- **Component-Specific Derived State**:
  - `selectorFamily` enables the creation of selectors tailored to specific components, ensuring encapsulation and modularity.
  - Avoids coupling derived state computations across components, promoting maintainability and scalability.

```javascript
import { RecoilRoot, useRecoilValue } from 'recoil';
import { todoSelectorFamily } from './selectors';

function TodoComponent({ id }) {
  const todo = useRecoilValue(todoSelectorFamily(id));

  return (
    <>
      {todo.title}
      {todo.description}
    </>
  )
}
```

In summary, `selectorFamily` in Recoil provides a versatile mechanism for managing dynamic computations and derived state in applications, offering flexibility, efficiency, and component-level control over derived state instances.
